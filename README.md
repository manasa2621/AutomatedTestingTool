## Notes to Team
- Once cloned ensure you are running in virtual environment. 
- Ensure that you use python(3) run.py to host it on local server (5000 port)
- When you commit to gitlab use your initials then type your message for commit. For example: git commit -m "VP - Created the flask server."

## Project Plan 
- Team opted to use flask server, package structure, routes and temnplating method to incorporate everyone features work. 

- Every individual is responsible for their feature and incorporating their working using Jinja2 and templating to the flask sever. 

- Team has agreed common font and colour theme to ensure the overall web application follows a unison practice. This will prove to show independent working as well as effective team working. 

- Team has agreed to use Bootstrap.
